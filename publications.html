			<p>The Bank of Canada working paper: <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2023/02/staff-working-paper-2023-13/"> link </a> </p>
			<p>This paper investigates equilibria selection and price dynamics in a complex OLG economy with multiple perfect-foresight equilibria using learning-to-forecast and learning-to-optimize experiments. In the theoretical model, these dynamics depend on one utility function parameter. We
conduct five treatments to test price convergence and coordination with different values of this parameter corresponding to (i) a stable 2-cycle, (ii) a stable 3-cycle, (iii) a stable 4-cycle, and (iv)
chaos. This paper highlights three key findings: First, price converges to the simplest equilibria (steady state and 2-cycle) in all groups of the learning-to-forecast experiment. Second, convergence to the 2-cycle occurs for the intermediate parameter range, while theoretical scenarios of
2-cycle and highly nonlinear dynamics (chaos) lead to coordination on the steady state in the lab. Finally, convergence in the learning-to-optimize experiment is harder to achieve, and the 2-cycle is not observed although it Pareto dominates the steady state in terms of payoff </p>

			<p> After decades of stable prices, central bankers face the crucial challenge of keeping inflation and inflation expectations contained. We show a strong relationship between households’ perceptions about average inflation over the past 12 months and households’ short- and long-term expectations about future inflation. The strength of this pass-through from perceptions to expectations varies across socioeconomic groups. We find two key moderating
factors for this heterogeneity: differential information sources used to form inflation perceptions and differences in individual uncertainty about future inflation. We find that when assessing average inflation over the last 12 months the large majority of households report
reliance upon their own shopping experience rather than information they have heard or read. Our results suggest that in seeking to manage inflation expectations, central bankers could beneficially spend further effort in managing inflation perceptions.</p>

			<li class="paper" words="uncertainty, price setting, firms, expectations, shocks"> <strong> The Effects of Macro and Micro Shocks on the Decisions of Firms </strong> </li>
			<p> I study how firms’ uncertainty, expectations, and decisions react to macro and micro shocks using a representative survey. I define macro shocks as the ones that affect only the general economic conditions and micro shocks as those affecting only firms’ own performance. The
paper focuses on two adverse events that firms in Germany faced over the period from 2020 until 2023, the war in Ukraine and Covid-19 pandemic. I identify the firms that suffered only a macro shock after these events and the enterprises which faced both macro and micro shocks. The paper’s first important takeaway is that firms’ reactions are specific to the type of shock they are facing. The war in Ukraine and the Covid-19 pandemic cause
different responses from firms. Second, macro and micro shocks affect firms’ uncertainty,
expectations, and decisions differently. In particular, the firms that suffer both types of
shocks are more uncertain, and they expect a worse performance of their own firm and the
economy in general. They are more likely to take a loan. Also, these enterprises change
prices less after a demand shock and increase prices more after a supply shock. Finally, I
identify two channels through which the shocks affect firms’ decisions. These channels are
uncertainty and expectations.
